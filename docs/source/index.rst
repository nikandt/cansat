**What is Cansat?**

The CanSat is a simulated satellite â€” integrated within the volume and shape of a soft drink can.

CanSat competitions provide an opportunity for students to design and build a simplified satellite system
and then test its functionality through a real-world launch scenario.
This allows for practical application of concepts from engineering, electronics, and computer science, while working
together with classmates on a fun project.
